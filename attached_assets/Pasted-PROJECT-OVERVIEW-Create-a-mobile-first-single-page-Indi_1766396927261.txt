PROJECT OVERVIEW
Create a mobile-first, single-page Indian wedding invitation website with a Shiva-Parvati deity theme. The site should feature immersive scroll-triggered animations, parallax effects (optimized for mobile), and modern UI trends including glassmorphism and mandala patterns. The entire experience should unfold as one continuous scroll journey, similar to Apple's product pages.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY & THEME
Core Theme: Shiva-Parvati Divine Union

Primary Imagery: Mount Kailash (Himalayan mountains), sacred rivers, crescent moon, trident (trishul), damaru (drum), lotus flowers, Rudraksha beads
Color Palette:

Deep blues (midnight blue #1a1d3d, royal blue #2c5f8d)
Icy whites and silvers (#f0f8ff, #c0d4e8)
Sacred saffron/gold accents (#f4a460, #d4af37)
Earthy greens for nature elements (#2d5f3e, #4a7856)
Pure white for purity (#ffffff)


Typography:

Primary: Modern sans-serif (like Poppins or Inter) for readability on mobile
Accent: Elegant serif or devanagari-inspired font for Sanskrit mantras
Ensure minimum 16px on mobile, 18px+ for body text



Visual Style:

Modern glassmorphism UI elements floating over traditional mandala backgrounds
Subtle neumorphic depth for interactive elements
Hand-drawn mandala patterns with animated reveals
Minimalist yet spiritual aesthetic
Frosted glass cards with blur effects for content sections


MOBILE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
Responsive Breakpoints:

Mobile: 320px - 767px (primary design target)
Tablet: 768px - 1024px
Desktop: 1025px+

Mobile Optimization Requirements:

Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44px for buttons)
Simplified parallax effects for mobile (subtle, performance-optimized)
Lazy loading for all images
Maximum 3-second load time on 3G networks
Reduce parallax speed/complexity on mobile to prevent motion sickness
Use CSS transforms and GPU acceleration for smooth animations
Implement intersection observer API for scroll-triggered animations

PARALLAX EFFECT SPECIFICATIONS
Mobile-Optimized Parallax:

Reduced Parallax Speed:

Desktop: Background moves at 0.5x scroll speed
Mobile: Background moves at 0.8x scroll speed (more subtle)


Layer System:

Background layer (slowest): Mountains, sky
Middle layer (medium speed): Clouds, water
Foreground layer (normal speed): Content, UI elements


Implementation:

Use CSS transform: translateY() instead of background-position for better mobile performance
Apply will-change: transform on parallax elements
Use requestAnimationFrame for scroll calculations
Implement debouncing on scroll events


Mobile-Specific Adjustments:

Disable heavy parallax effects on devices with reduced motion preference
Simplify to 2 layers maximum on small screens
Use CSS-only parallax where possible (transform3d)



Parallax Examples:

Hero mountain layers move at 0.5x, 0.7x, 1x speeds
Floating mandala patterns drift at 0.3x speed
Cloud elements move horizontally while page scrolls vertically
Water reflections shift with slight delay


ANIMATION LIBRARY & EFFECTS
Scroll-Triggered Animations (use Intersection Observer):

Fade In Up: Elements slide up 30px while fading in
Scale In: Elements start at 0.8 scale, grow to 1.0
Stagger: Sequential animations with 100ms delay between items
Draw In: SVG path stroke animations (for mandalas, timelines)
Blur to Focus: Elements start blurred, sharpen as they enter viewport

Continuous Animations:

Mandala Rotation: Slow 60-second rotation
Particle Float: Gentle upward drift of light particles
Star Twinkle: Random opacity changes for star elements
Water Ripple: Subtle wave effect on water backgrounds
Glow Pulse: Soft breathing animation on sacred symbols

Interaction Animations:

Button Hover/Tap: Scale 1.05 + glow effect
Card Hover: Lift (translateY -10px) + shadow increase
Form Focus: Input field glow + label float
Gallery Zoom: Smooth scale transform on tap


GLASSMORPHISM IMPLEMENTATION
CSS Properties for Glass Effect:
css.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px) saturate(150%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px) saturate(150%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
Application Areas:

Hero introduction card
Event detail cards
RSVP form container
Navigation menu (if sticky)
Photo gallery overlays

Accessibility Considerations:

Ensure text contrast ratio of 4.5:1 minimum on glass backgrounds
Add semi-opaque color layer if transparency reduces readability
Test on both light and dark background contexts


MANDALA DESIGN ELEMENTS
Mandala Types:

Geometric: Perfect circles, sacred geometry patterns
Floral: Lotus petals, jasmine flowers
Om Symbol: Stylized Om integrated into mandala center

Rotation: Continuous slow spin (60-120 seconds)
Color Shift: Gradual hue rotation in background mandalas
Particle Burst: Mandala fragments on form submission success

Placement:
